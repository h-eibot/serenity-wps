Serenity is a branch of the Reaver 1.4 code. Development support of Reaver was halted in early 2012. As a result, Serenity was created to add bug fixes, enhancements and new features.

Serenity, like Reaver, implements a brute force attack against Wifi Protected Setup (WPS) to recover WPA/WPA2 passphrases. The brute-force mechanism on which Serenity is based is documented in the whitepaper: http://sviehb.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/viehboeck_wps.pdf.

Whereas Reaver had a very precise focus, I'd like to make Serenity more of a general purpose router/wireless/access point hacking tool. Feel free to submit ideas. This is an open-source community effort. The more participation we get, the more effective Serenity will become.
